Fixes needed to bring the new reporting suite up to scratch

From Alban:
The reporting capabilities gap between the old and new report suites looks better but we still cannot use the new reporting suite for all of our reporting. Ranjan has implemented basic tracking on TES Communities for the new reporting suite. 

Many changes required should be quick and easy such as making sure that the pages in the new reporting suite use the correct site section name.
